# 💙 CSS Animated Text ("I Love ...")

A simple **HTML + CSS project** that creates an animated text effect. The phrase **“I Love”** is displayed, and the word following it changes dynamically using CSS keyframes, cycling through multiple options.

## ✨ Features
- **Dynamic Text Animation**  
  - Uses `::after` pseudo-element to append changing words after “I Love”.  
  - Cycles through **Tech → Watches → Cars** in a loop.  

- **Smooth Transitions**  
  - CSS `@keyframes` animation runs infinitely with a 4-second cycle.  
  - Background color and rounded styling applied to each word for emphasis.  

- **Customizable Styling**  
  - Font family: *Noto Sans* from Google Fonts.  
  - Font size: Large (4em) for bold display.  
  - Colors, words, and timing can be easily adjusted.  

- **Responsive Centering**  
  - Flexbox centers the text both vertically and horizontally on the page.  

- **Minimal Structure**  
  - Simple HTML with a single `<div>` and `<b>` element.  
  - Lightweight CSS handles all animation logic.
